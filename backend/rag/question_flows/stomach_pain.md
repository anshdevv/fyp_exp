# Question Flow: Stomach Pain

Ask the patient the following questions in order:

1. When did the stomach pain start?
2. Where exactly is the pain? (upper/lower, left/right abdomen)
3. What type of pain is it? (sharp, dull, cramping)
4. Is the pain constant or comes and goes?
5. Do you have nausea or vomiting?
6. Do you have diarrhea or constipation?
7. Does eating food make pain better or worse?
8. Did you eat outside food recently?
9. Do you have fever with the pain?
10. Any blood in stool? (Red flag)

Rules:
- Do NOT diagnose.
- Ask one question at a time.
- Keep questions short and simple.
- Summarize answers for the doctor at the end.
